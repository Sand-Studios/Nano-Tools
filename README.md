nanotools
=========

A very small PHP tool set. Handles simple routing, templating, classloading, and IoC. Meant as an absolute barebone library, when everything else would be overkill. 

todo
----
- Refactor Routes & Container to also work non-statically
    * Similar to ClassLoader
    * Keep the static helpers
- More Docs
- Better Tests
- Demo Project (separate from the lib itself)
- Make a composer package (separate demo from actual lib)
